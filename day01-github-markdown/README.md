Day 1 - GitHub and Markdown
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.
- `activity00.pdf` - a PDF document that you will think critically about
  shortly.

## Task 1: View the PDF in GitHub

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  Locate and click on the `activity01-day01.pdf` file to view it. You
    might want to open this in a separate/new tab so that you can easily
    switch between this `README` file and the PDF document.
2.  On a piece of scrape paper or in a document on your computer,
    specify the different ways this document has been formatted using
    Markdown. Note that I tried to incorporate most of the Markdown
    skills that I use in my typical workflow. Can you identify them all?

![check-in](../README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Take a moment to reflect on what this process is like compared to other
methods you have used for sharing documents with others.

- Did you identify 11 unique Markdown skills being used in the PDF? Try
  hovering your mouse over the text in the final bullet point in the PDF
  if you are only coming up with 10 skills.
- A more comprehensive guide to use Markdown syntax can be found on the
  [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) page
  along with best practices and cautions. What are two or three “Best
  Practices” that you weren’t aware of and will make an effort to pay
  attention to in your work for the next month?

## Task 2: Create a Document

Verify that you are in the `day01-github-markdown` subfolder of your
GitHub repo. If you are currently reading this sentence, you should be
here.

1.  Near the top of this page, click on **Add file** and then select
    “Create new file”.
2.  Name your file `firstname.md`, where you have replaced `firstname`
    with your first name.
3.  Using multiple of your Markdown skills, respond add content to this
    new file. Minimally, you should respond to the two bulleted items
    below. Note that you can preview your work by clicking on the
    **Preview** tab at the top of your Markdown file. Remember there was
    a helpful cheatsheet here: <https://commonmark.org/help/>.
4.  When you have finished, provide a **Commit Message**. Provide a
    brief description of what you did where it currently says “Create
    new file” in the **Commit new file** area at the bottom of the page.
    Then, click on the green button to commit your file.
5.  Verify that your `firstname.md` file looks how you intend, then post
    the weblink to this document in the **General** channel of our Teams
    workspace (linked on Blackboard). Look at what others post here to
    gain inspiration and feel free to cheer each other on.

Respond to these items:

- Using the Markdown syntax to embed an image (not link to an image),
  select a meme that represents how Week 1 (last week) went for you.
- Provide a brief explanation for why you selected the meme that you
  did.
  
## What is next?

So far our workflow is:

![Blackboard icon to fork icon to edit icon to commit
icon](../README-img/current-workflow.svg)

Or in words:

1.  I will post a link to an activity repo on Blackboard,
2.  You will make your own copy of (fork) this repo,
3.  You will edit and work on the activity, and
4.  You will commit your changes.

In **Day 2**, we will update this workflow to include how we can work
between GitHub and RStudio.
